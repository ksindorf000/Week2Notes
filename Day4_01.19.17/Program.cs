         * -------- SOLID PRINCIPLES OF OOP -------- 
         * 
         * 1) S ingle Responsibility Principle
         *      A class should only have "responsibilities" that make
         *      sense for their objects
         *          ex) You have two classes, "Dog" and "Car." A dog should
         *      not be able to make a car go faster and a car should not
         *      be able to bark.
         * 2) O pen/Closed http://joelabrahamsson.com/a-simple-example-of-the-openclosed-principle/
         *      Open for extension
         *      Use Overrides, Overloads, & Sub Classes
         *      Closed for modification
         * 3) L iskov 
         *      A subclass can be replaced by it's parent 
         * 4) I nterface Segregation
         * 5) D ependency Inversion
